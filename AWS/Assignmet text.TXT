This assignment on AWS. Please build the VPC shown in the AWS sldies, and recrod a video that is no longer than 25 mins (20 mins preferable). Videos should be uploaded on youtube privtate listing with clear voice and resolution. 

- Outstanding people will do (or attempt) the extras, in top of the reuried points

- Good people will do the required points

In case you see that it is difficult for you to come up with the required VPC, you can build a simple VPC of one public subnet and one private subnet (with one server in each subnet) - that will be only acceptable level. 

 

I would encourage all of you to add AWS to your skills - trust me, you won't regret it!
