Assume that you are a Java developer in company A. Show a scenario of using IntelliJ, Git, and Github to collaborate with
your colleagues in the company to build a product. Use any of the Git
workflows you see suitable and capture all of that in a a 10 mins
video that demonstrates your understanding of version control using
Git and Github. 
Keep product code/features/classes simple â€“ The idea here is to test
your Git and Github knowledge and skills, not to test your Java coding
abilities. For recording the video, use any simple screen capturing
software. Host your video anywhere (G-Drive or youtube private
listing for example), and share the link on your schoology assignment
submission.
